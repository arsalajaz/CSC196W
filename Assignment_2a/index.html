    <h1>Web Programming</h1>

    <p href="https://google.com"> I started learning web programming about a year ago with basic HTML, CSS, and Javascript. 
        <br>Meanwhile, I also learned how to use bootstrap and jQuery on my web pages. After I became comfortable building 
        <br>simple web pages, I similarized myself with backend technologies. I watched videos on Node.js and learned to build REST APIs. 
        <br>However, in the last few months, I've been required to learn many of the front-end JS frameworks like <strong>React</strong> and <strong>Angular</strong>
        <br>for course projects and internships.
